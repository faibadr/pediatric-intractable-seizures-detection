# seizure-detection-for
This repository contains code for a logistic regression-based model designed for seizure detection in pediatric EEG recordings. The model, trained and tested on a dataset collected at the Childrenâ€™s Hospital Boston, leverages distinctive EEG patterns associated with seizures to achieve high accuracy in identifying seizure events.

The dataset comprises EEG recordings from pediatric subjects with intractable seizures, monitored for up to several days following withdrawal of anti-seizure medication. The dataset includes three sets:

Set B: Contains EEG recordings of healthy subjects.
Set C: Consists of inter-ictal data representing the transition between healthy and seizure states.
Set E: Comprises ictal data representing seizure activity.
Recordings have a sampling rate of 173.61 Hz and a spectral bandwidth of 0.5 Hz to 85 Hz, reflecting the acquisition system's characteristics.

This logistic regression-based model provides an effective tool for early detection and intervention in pediatric patients with epilepsy, contributing to improved patient outcomes and treatment planning.
